JU
==

Overview
--------

JU is a shared utility system that provides core features used across multiple systems.
It is designed to be modular, lightweight, and independent, with no direct references to other JU's systems.

Although JU is commonly used as a foundation for higher-level systems, it can also be integrated
and used as a standalone module without requiring additional dependencies.

Its primary purpose is to centralize reusable functionality, reduce duplication, and establish
consistent patterns across projects.
