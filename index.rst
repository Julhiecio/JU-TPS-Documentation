Project Documentation
=====================

Overview
--------

This documentation serves as a centralized reference for JU systems used across different projects.
Each system is documented independently, but follows shared conventions, patterns, and design principles.

The goal of this documentation is to provide clear, practical, and technical guidance for developers,
covering architecture, usage, and integration details without unnecessary abstraction.

Use this documentation as a starting point to understand each system and navigate to its specific
reference when needed.
